# Hello - Web Socket Study
Hello is a simple chat app!

<p>I did this project to apply my knowledge on WebSocket.</p>
<p>In login page you put your username (it will appear to identify your message) and the room id (you can put any id you want!). If other people login in the app using the same id you used, you can send messages to each other.</p>

<p> I'm using <a href= https://piehost.com/piesocket>PieSocket</a> to host this, using the Free Cluster, so it can suport 0.2 million messages per day and 200 concurrent connections.</p>
<p>I haven't tested what happens when you go over the limit, but probably the server crashes(obviously).</p>
<p>You can clone the project and build to talk with other people!</p>
